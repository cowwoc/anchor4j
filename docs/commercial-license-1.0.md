**Commercial License Agreement â€“ Anchor4J**

This agreement governs the use of the commercial edition of Anchor4J.

1. License Grant  
   Subject to payment of the applicable fees, 9187219 Canada Inc. grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable
   license to use, copy, and modify the Software for any supported Java Development Kit (JDK) version,
   including, for example, JDK 17.
   All uses are subject to the restrictions defined in Section 4, including but not limited to prohibitions on
   circumventing license obligations.

   This license is required if:

   - You compile, run, or distribute the Software on any JDK version other than the latest GA release.
   - Your organization has more than 10 employees.
   - You intend to white-label, rebrand, or distribute the Software without attribution.

2. License Scope  
   A user is any individual who writes, compiles, tests, or debugs source code that directly or transitively
   integrates with Anchor4J APIs or with any abstraction or wrapper of Anchor4J developed by or for your
   organization or its subsidiaries.

   No license is required for individuals who merely use, deploy, or operate a product that includes Anchor4J,
   provided they do not write or modify source code that integrates with Anchor4J APIs. This exemption
   applies to downstream users and customers of your product.

   This standard license does not include rights to white-label or rebrand the Software. White-labeling
   requires a separate commercial agreement with explicit written permission.

   A subsidiary is defined as any entity directly or indirectly controlled by your organization through
   ownership of more than 50% of the voting shares or equivalent control.

3. Support Term
   You are entitled to receive support services from 9187219 Canada Inc. for a period of one (1) year from the
   date your license fees were last paid in full. Support includes bug fixes, updates, and technical
   assistance as described in the separate [support policy](support-policy-1.0.md). Support does not include
   implementation of new features or custom development requests. Continued support beyond this period
   requires renewal of the license fees.

4. Restrictions
   You may not:
   - Remove or alter any license notices, attributions, or embedded watermarks in the Software.
   - White-label or represent the Software as your own without prior written approval.
   - Wrap, abstract, or obfuscate access to the Anchor4J API to circumvent per-user licensing obligations.
   - Use code generators, compile-time adapters, or similar tools to enable unlicensed use of Anchor4J
     functionality.
   - Use Anchor4J in any way that violates the spirit or intent of the licensing terms.

   These restrictions are in place to ensure fairness and sustainability of the licensing model. Any attempt
   to bypass license terms, whether technical or contractual, constitutes a material breach of this agreement.

5. Redistribution of Modified Versions  
   You may distribute modified versions of the Software only if all original license terms and notices are
   preserved. Redistributions must comply with all original license conditions, including usage restrictions,
   attribution requirements, and organizational eligibility.

6. Compliance and Audit Rights
   9187219 Canada Inc. reserves the right to request, at most once per calendar year, a written attestation of
   compliance with the license terms. You agree to provide, within 30 days of such a request, a good-faith
   written accounting of the number of users, as defined in Section 2, who have used Anchor4J during the
   preceding 12 months.

7. Termination
   This license may be terminated if you breach its terms or fail to pay license fees.
